# Interview Prep: Insert a Node into a Max Binary Heap

## Description of Problems, Constraints

### Task 0: Write a function that creates a binary tree node

* Prototype: `binary_tree_t *binary_tree_node(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);`
<br>

### Task 1: Write a function that inserts a node into a max binary heap.

* Prototype: `heap_t *heap_insert(heap_t **head, int value);`
* The function can have up to 5 helper functions.
<br>

### What is a [max binary heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)), you ask?

In essence, it's a tree-like data structure where values are sorted from greatest to lowest.

Details in the [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)).

## My Proposed Solution ðŸ’¡

### **14 december 2020** - there's only one real way to do this, so here it is

```c
heap_t *heap_insert(heap_t **head, int value)
{
	return (node);
}
```
