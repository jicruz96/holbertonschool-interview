# Interview Prep: Insert a Node into a Max Binary Heap

## Description of Problems, Constraints

### Task 0: Write a function that creates a binary tree node

* Prototype: `binary_tree_t *binary_tree_node(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);`
<br>

### Task 1: Write a function that inserts a node into a max binary heap.

* Prototype: `heap_t *heap_insert(heap_t **head, int value);`
* The function can have up to 5 helper functions.
<br>

### What is a [max binary heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)), you ask?

In essence, it's a tree-like data structure where values are sorted from greatest to lowest.

Details in the [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)).

## Proposed Solution ðŸ’¡

### 19 december 2020

My proposed solution uses three self-built helper functions. 
* `binary_tree_height()` -> computes heap height; needed for insertion
* `complete_tree_insert()` -> inserts new node, preserving completeness of heap
* `adjust_node()` -> moves node to apprpopriate spot in tree to preserve heap nature

Function definitions can be seen in [1-heap_insert.c](./1-heap_insert.c)

The main function can also be seeen below:

```c
heap_t *heap_insert(heap_t **head, int value)
{
	heap_t *node, *tmp;
	int height;

	/* If no tree exists, make node head of tree and return */
	if (*head == NULL)
	{
		node = binary_tree_node(NULL, value);
		*head = node;
		return (node);
	}

	/* Get tree height */
	height = binary_tree_height(*head);

	/* Insert node tree into node without regard for sorting */
	node = complete_tree_insert(*head, value, height - 1, 1);

	/* If node was not inserted, then node goes as left as possible */
	if (!node)
	{
		for (tmp = *head; tmp->left; tmp = tmp->left)
			;
		node = binary_tree_node(tmp, value);
		tmp->left = node;
	}

	/* heapify the tree! */
	adjust_node(node);

	/* If node, after heapification, is the head, set head equal to it */
	if (node->parent == NULL)
		*head = node;
		
	return (node);
}
```
