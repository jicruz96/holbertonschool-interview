# Interview Prep: Infinite Multiplication

## Description of Problems, Constraints

**Write a CLI program in C that multiplies two positive integers**

* Usage: `./mul num1 num2`
* The only C library functions you are allowed to use are:
    * `malloc`
    * `free`
    * `exit`
    * `write`
* **_Everything else must be made from scratch_**
* If the number of arguments is incorrect or one of the arguments is not a positive integer, print `Error`, followed by a new line, and exit with status `98`.
