# Interview Prep: Making Change

## Description of Problem

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Radix sort algorithm

* Prototype: `void radix_sort(int *array, size_t size);`
* You must implement the LSD radix sort algorithm
* You can assume that array will contain only numbers >= 0
* You are allowed to use malloc and free for this task
