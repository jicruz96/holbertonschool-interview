# Interview Prep: Island Perimeter

## Description of Problem

Create a function `def island_perimeter(grid):` that returns the perimeter of the island described in `grid`:

* `grid` is a list of list of integers:
    * 0 represents water
    * 1 represents land
* Each cell is square, with a side length of 1
* Cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
* `grid` is rectangular, with its width and height not exceeding 100
* The grid is completely surrounded by water
* There is only one island (or nothing).
* The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to the water surrounding the island).
